# Financial Data Analysis FI4090
Financial Data Analysis in R Studio
Repository of class assignments. 

## Topics covered include:

# Linear Regression
# Multiple Linear Regression
# Logistical Regression (Qualitative and Quantitative variables)
# LASSO

All of these projects are heavily 
commented to maximize their usefulness
as a tool for learning. I know a lot of 
Finance students struggle with this class, 
as it serves as their introduction to programming, so 
hopefully this will be helpful to some someone.
